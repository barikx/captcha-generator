Creating a captcha generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript could be quite an important skill for a developer. Whether you’re building a personal website or developing a client’s site.

The purpose of this project is to teach you how to develop a Captcha Generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Essentially, we’ll be designing a form that randomly generates a combination of letters and numbers in an unordered format. We’ll then need to fill in the correct letters to determine if we’ve accurately solved the captcha. By the end of this post, you’ll have gained the knowledge and skills needed to create and implement captchas on your own websites.
